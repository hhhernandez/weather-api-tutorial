# Troubleshooting Guide: Common Issues and Solutions

## Introduction

This guide addresses the most common challenges encountered when working with complex weather APIs, using lessons learned from successful IPMA integration. Rather than providing exhaustive troubleshooting for every possible scenario, this guide teaches you systematic diagnostic approaches that apply broadly to weather API challenges.

Remember that debugging complex APIs requires patience and systematic thinking. Each error message or unexpected result provides valuable information about how the system actually works, even when it initially seems frustrating or confusing.

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

When encountering unexpected behavior with weather APIs, work through this systematic checklist before diving into detailed troubleshooting:

**Basic Connectivity**: Can you retrieve any response from the API endpoint? Check internet connectivity and confirm the endpoint URL is correct.

**Response Status**: What HTTP status code does the API return? Status 200 indicates success, while 4xx codes suggest request problems and 5xx codes indicate server issues.

**Response Content**: Does the API return data, even if it's not organized as expected? Empty responses indicate different problems than responses with unexpected structures.

**Data Structure**: Does the actual JSON structure match your assumptions about data organization? Use raw content examination before assuming structure problems indicate API failures.

**Timing Factors**: Do weather APIs update on specific schedules that might affect data availability? Some services provide observations only at certain intervals or after quality control delays.

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### Symptom: Connection Timeouts or Network Errors

Network problems represent the most straightforward category of API issues, but they can manifest in ways that initially seem like complex data structure problems.

**Diagnostic Approach**:
```r
# Test basic connectivity with timeout controls
response <- GET(api_url, timeout(10))
print(paste("Status code:", status_code(response)))
print(paste("Response time:", response$times[["total"]]))
```

**Common Causes**: Unstable internet connections, firewall restrictions, or temporary server maintenance at the weather service. Corporate networks sometimes block access to foreign government APIs or require proxy configurations.

**Solutions**: Try accessing the API from different network locations, check with network administrators about firewall policies, or implement retry logic with exponential backoff for temporary connectivity issues.

**When to Seek Help**: If connectivity problems persist across different networks and time periods, the weather service might be experiencing technical difficulties. Check their official status pages or contact their technical support.

### Symptom: Inconsistent Response Times

Some weather APIs experience performance variations that affect application reliability, particularly during severe weather events when usage increases significantly.

**Diagnostic Approach**:
```r
# Monitor response time patterns
start_time <- Sys.time()
response <- GET(api_url)
end_time <- Sys.time()
response_time <- as.numeric(end_time - start_time)
print(paste("Response time:", round(response_time, 2), "seconds"))
```

**Common Causes**: Server load variations, geographic distance from API servers, or peak usage periods when many applications request data simultaneously.

**Solutions**: Implement timeout controls with reasonable limits, consider caching strategies for data that doesn't change frequently, or schedule data collection during off-peak hours when possible.

## HTTP Status Code Problems

### 404 Not Found Errors

404 errors often occur when API endpoints change or when URL construction contains subtle errors that aren't immediately obvious.

**Diagnostic Approach**: Examine the exact URL being requested and compare it character-by-character with working examples. Pay special attention to trailing slashes, file extensions, and case sensitivity.

**Common Causes**: API versioning changes, incorrect endpoint paths, or case-sensitive servers that require exact URL matching.

**Solutions**: Check API documentation for current endpoint URLs, verify that version numbers in URLs match current API versions, or contact the weather service to confirm correct endpoint formats.

### 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized Errors

Authentication and authorization problems can occur even with APIs that claim to be completely open, depending on usage patterns or geographic restrictions.

**Diagnostic Approach**: Review API documentation for any authentication requirements, rate limiting policies, or geographic access restrictions that might apply to your location or usage patterns.

**Common Causes**: API key requirements that weren't clearly documented, rate limiting thresholds exceeded, or geographic restrictions that block access from certain countries or IP address ranges.

**Solutions**: Register for API keys if required, implement request throttling to stay within rate limits, or use VPN services if geographic restrictions prevent access.

## Data Structure Confusion

### Symptom: "Object of type 'list' not subsettable" Errors

This error typically occurs when your code assumes data frame organization but the API returns nested list structures that require different navigation approaches.

**Diagnostic Approach**:
```r
# Examine actual data structure systematically
print("Data type:", class(parsed_data))
print("Length/dimensions:", length(parsed_data))
if (is.list(parsed_data)) {
  print("Element names:", names(parsed_data))
  str(parsed_data, max.level = 2)
}
```

**Common Causes**: APIs that use nested object hierarchies rather than flat tabular structures, or JSON parsing that creates different R data types than expected.

**Solutions**: Use systematic navigation with `$` operators for list elements, employ `str()` function to understand actual data organization, or implement recursive exploration functions for complex nested structures.

### Symptom: "Undefined columns selected" Errors

Column access errors indicate mismatches between expected data frame structure and actual API organization, as demonstrated in the IPMA debugging journey.

**Diagnostic Approach**: Examine column names directly using `names()` function and compare with your attempted access patterns. Check whether data exists in nested structures rather than direct columns.

**Common Causes**: Nested data frames within larger structures, different naming conventions than expected, or APIs that organize information hierarchically rather than in flat tables.

**Solutions**: Use nested access patterns like `data$properties$column_name`, implement data flattening procedures to convert hierarchical structures to tabular formats, or adjust your expectations about data organization based on actual API behavior.

## Timestamp and Time Zone Issues

### Symptom: Inconsistent or Confusing Time Stamps

Weather data timestamps can use various formats, time zones, and conventions that create confusion when combining data from multiple sources or time periods.

**Diagnostic Approach**:
```r
# Examine timestamp formats and time zone information
sample_timestamp <- data$timestamp[1]
print("Raw timestamp:", sample_timestamp)
parsed_time <- ymd_hms(sample_timestamp)
print("Parsed time:", parsed_time)
print("Time zone:", tz(parsed_time))
```

**Common Causes**: APIs that use UTC versus local time, different timestamp formats (ISO 8601 versus proprietary formats), or daylight saving time transitions that create apparent data gaps or duplications.

**Solutions**: Use `lubridate` package functions for robust timestamp parsing, explicitly specify time zones using `with_tz()` function, or implement validation checks that identify timestamp anomalies.

## Missing or Invalid Data Handling

### Symptom: Unexpected NA Values or Impossible Measurements

Weather data contains various types of missing or invalid values that require appropriate handling to prevent analysis errors.

**Diagnostic Approach**: 
```r
# Identify patterns in missing or invalid data
summary(weather_data$temperature)  # Look for suspicious min/max values
table(weather_data$pressure)       # Check for repeated invalid codes
sum(is.na(weather_data$humidity))  # Count missing values
```

**Common Causes**: Sensor maintenance periods, quality control procedures that flag unreliable measurements, or standardized missing data codes that need conversion to NA values.

**Solutions**: Learn the specific missing data conventions used by your weather API, implement systematic conversion procedures for invalid data codes, or develop interpolation strategies for handling missing values in time series analysis.

## Rate Limiting and Usage Restrictions

### Symptom: Requests Start Failing After Working Initially

Many weather APIs implement rate limiting that restricts the number of requests allowed within specific time periods.

**Diagnostic Approach**: Monitor response headers for rate limiting information, implement logging to track request frequencies, and review API documentation for stated usage limits.

**Common Causes**: Exceeding requests per minute limits, daily quota exhaustion, or APIs that implement different limits for different types of requests.

**Solutions**: Implement request throttling with appropriate delays, cache responses to reduce redundant requests, or batch multiple data requirements into fewer API calls.

## Advanced Diagnostic Techniques

### Systematic Data Structure Exploration

When encountering completely unfamiliar API responses, use this systematic exploration approach:

```r
# Comprehensive structure examination
explore_api_structure <- function(data, max_depth = 3) {
  if (is.list(data) && max_depth > 0) {
    cat("List with", length(data), "elements:\n")
    for (i in seq_along(data)) {
      element_name <- names(data)[i] %||% paste("Element", i)
      cat("  ", element_name, ":", class(data[[i]]), "\n")
      if (is.list(data[[i]])) {
        explore_api_structure(data[[i]], max_depth - 1)
      }
    }
  }
}

explore_api_structure(parsed_response)
```

This recursive exploration reveals nested organization patterns that might not be obvious from simple `str()` output, especially in deeply nested structures.

### Response Content Analysis

For APIs returning unexpected content types or formats:

```r
# Analyze raw response characteristics
raw_content <- content(response, "text")
cat("Content length:", nchar(raw_content), "\n")
cat("First character:", substr(raw_content, 1, 1), "\n")
cat("Content type:", headers(response)$`content-type`, "\n")

# Look for common format indicators
if (grepl("^\\[", raw_content)) {
  cat("Appears to be JSON array\n")
} else if (grepl("^\\{", raw_content)) {
  cat("Appears to be JSON object\n")
} else {
  cat("May not be JSON format\n")
}
```

This analysis helps distinguish between JSON formatting problems, unexpected content types, and non-JSON responses that require different handling approaches.

## When to Seek Additional Help

### Weather Service Documentation and Support

Most meteorological organizations provide comprehensive documentation and user support for their data services. Look for official API documentation, user forums, or technical support contacts when systematic troubleshooting doesn't resolve persistent issues.

### Community Resources and Forums

Weather data integration challenges often have solutions available through community resources like Stack Overflow, R-Help mailing lists, or specialized meteorological programming communities.

### Professional Development Resources

For deeper understanding of meteorological data management, consider resources from the World Meteorological Organization, national weather service training materials, or academic courses in meteorological data analysis.

## Building Robust Error Handling

### Implementing Graceful Degradation

Design your weather monitoring systems to continue functioning even when specific data sources become temporarily unavailable:

```r
# Example of robust error handling
safe_weather_request <- function(url) {
  tryCatch({
    response <- GET(url, timeout(10))
    if (status_code(response) == 200) {
      return(fromJSON(content(response, "text")))
    } else {
      warning("API returned status:", status_code(response))
      return(NULL)
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    warning("Request failed:", e$message)
    return(NULL)
  })
}
```

This approach allows your system to handle temporary API problems without crashing, while providing informative logging about what went wrong.

### Creating Diagnostic Reports

Implement systematic diagnostic reporting that helps you understand API behavior patterns over time:

```r
# Diagnostic logging approach
log_api_attempt <- function(url, success, response_time, error_message = NULL) {
  log_entry <- data.frame(
    timestamp = Sys.time(),
    endpoint = url,
    success = success,
    response_time = response_time,
    error = error_message %||% "None",
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
  
  # Append to log file or database
  write.table(log_entry, "api_diagnostics.log", append = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
}
```

This logging approach helps you identify patterns in API reliability and optimize your data collection strategies based on actual performance characteristics rather than assumptions about ideal behavior.

Remember that mastering weather API integration requires patience and systematic thinking. Each challenge you encounter and resolve builds expertise that applies to future projects and different weather services. The debugging skills you develop working with complex meteorological APIs transfer directly to other domains where systematic data extraction supports scientific and commercial applications.
